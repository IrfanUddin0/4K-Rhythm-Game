# 4-Key Rhythm Game
A 4k Rhythm Game, made this as an exercise for using React to make a game.

## Additional Notes
In the [tools directory](./tools/) there is a python script that allows you to convert osu!mania maps to use in this game.
<br>
To do this, make a directory in the tools folder with the .osu files in there and then run:
### `python osu_mania_mapsetConverter.py [directory-name]`
<br>
Then add the out_map.json file somewhere in the [public directory](./public/) and add that path as an entry in [maps.json](./public/songs/maps.json)
